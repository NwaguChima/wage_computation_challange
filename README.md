## APPROACH

I started by reading input from my txt file, then creating an object store for my values for weekdays and weekends. I then splitted by = to get the name and details for each employee and then splited by , to get the various days work done. I got the initial for each day and then and then the time is taken as a substring. I then splitted the time and got the (start of work) and to(end of work) value. In the end, I used it to increase the totalcost variable.
